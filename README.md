# PorolytiX

This is my personal project using Riot Games's Developer API to create a web app for users to search a player's match history and details.

## Setup

To use this app, either:

Visit https://porolytix.herokuapp.com/

or

Fork this repo:

* To install dependencies
  `npm install`
* Make sure you have postgreSQL up and running
  <!-- * Seed your database
  `npm run seed` -->
* To build app and serve: in the console run `npm run start-dev`
* Go to localhost:8080 in your browser

Once the app is loaded in your browser, enter a player's username and you'll be taken to a page that displays their match list.
